-------------WORDBOT HELP-------------
[About]
 Wordbot passively monitors the words in
 a chat room and keeps a log of them.
 Pretty useless, other than it makes
 for interesting data.

[Config]
 The config is in a json format. Required
 variables to set are irc_port, irc_ip, 
 word_len_lim , chat_room, db-name,
 db-type, and sort_len.
 The only other thing to config is the
 banned.txt. It is a newline separated
 list of regex terms wordbot should ignore. 

[Commands]
 helpme			- displays this help file
 version 		- displays version
 view * 		- displays the selected option from [stack,users,db,log,status] *WARNING showing the db could take a while
 flush db		- flushes the db to the disk
 read config		- re read the config (used for updating banned.txt without restarting the server.)
 list			- lists available commands
 revisions		- shows the revision history of WordBot
 * realtime		- [command] realtime will show a realtime update of the command. The 'view db' command is not supported here.
			  This may be particularly useful for 'view stack realtime','view users realtime','view status realtime'
