Developing a web interface for WB2

Wordbot communicates using WebSockets. When a client connects, a User object is instantiated
and is put into an array of users. When the WS is closed, that object is destoyed and removed. 
The WS expects data in a valid JSON format. Currently supported operations are sorting, and fetching.
You do this via a JSON request in this format:

{
"request":REQ_TYPE
}

Where REQ_TYPE can be one of the following "A-Z","Z-A","ASC",or "DESC" for sorting or it can be another 
JSON object like

{
"fetch":[a,b]
}

where a,b are positive integers. A call like 

{
"request":
	{
	"fetch":[1,15]
	}
}

will return the indices 1-15 (which correlate to entries 2-16; it is a zero based index)
